/**
 * @author nitingupta2
 * There is a object state which is represented by two variables. How would
 * you write a high throughput non-blocking algorithm to update the state from multiple
 * threads?
 * <br>
 * ANS <BR>
 *     Non-blocking algorithms provide better throughput at low thread contention compared to the locking
 * counterpart. This can only be achieved in Java using CAS1
 *  (compare and swap) utilities provided in atomic
 * package. AtomicReference along with Immutable object can be used to write a non-blocking algorithm
 * maintaining a current state of Trade Volume.
 *
 * <ui>
 *     There are key points to be noted while writing non-blocking algorithm2
 *  are:<li>Immutability of TradeVolume as in below example is must to ensure proper initialization at it's assignment
 * time. Immutability is achieved by making all fields final and providing constructor initialization.</li>
 * <li> compareAndSet operation must be called repetitively in a while loop till the time it returns true.</li>
 * </ui>
 * This TradeVolume Class must be Immutable otherwise it may create Java Memory Model Problems
 * while using with Atomic Reference. All the fields must be final to guarantee the initialization
 * and assignment at the same time from other thread.
